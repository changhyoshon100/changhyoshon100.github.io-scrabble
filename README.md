Following is the definition of scrabble --->
Scrabble is a word game in which two to four players score points by placing tiles, each bearing a single letter, onto a game board divided into a 15Ã—15 grid of squares. The tiles must form words that, in crossword fashion, read left to right in rows or downward in columns and are included in a standard dictionary or lexicon.

So, I made 15*15 with array, and with reset button, everything will be gone just deleting all the data inside of array.
the dictionary comes from an api having all the english words and randomly pick one word that is puzzled with which a player should guess.
In case of no clue, there's a hint button. By clicking, it shows answer which is the word from dictionary before being puzzled.
and when encrypting, there's 2 way, vertical and horizontal, we can put either of them. 

If a player guess a word right, they will get some word scores. In the end, the one who has more score will win!!
